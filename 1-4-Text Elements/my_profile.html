        <h3>Aspiring software engineer</h3>
        <p>
            As a senior <strong>Computer Science</strong> student, I’ve been navigating my way through the complexities of the tech world, gradually finding clarity and purpose. Web development has stood out to me as a powerful, creative outlet—one that blends logic with design and serves as a bridge between users and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though I’ve struggled with consistency in the past, I’m now committed to developing my skills with focus and discipline. I’ve enrolled in <em>CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript</em> to deepen my understanding of frontend and backend technologies. My aim is to become proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django, and React, while also learning about hosting, SEO, scalability, and security.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond learning, I’m driven by the goal of starting a web and app development business that solves real-world problems—especially for underserved communities. One of my first projects is a halal travel guide targeting Muslims in America, offering verified halal options with a smooth and intuitive user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            My ultimate vision is to achieve professional-level web development skills within the next year, work remotely in tech, and use that freedom to support my family and live a life rooted in purpose and faith.
