        <h2>My Journey and Goals in Web Development</h2>
        <p>As a senior Computer Science student, I've been navigating my way through
            the complexities of the tech world, gradually finding clarity and purpose.
            Web development has stood out to me as a powerful, creative outlet—one that
            blends logic with design and serves as a bridge between users and technology.
        </p>
        <p>Though I've struggled with consistency in the past, I'm now committed to developing
            my skills with focus and discipline. I had enrolled in CS50's Web Programming with
            Python and JavaScript (while taking in-person CS classes at my university) to deepen
            my understanding of frontend and backend technologies. My aim is to become proficient
            in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django, and React etc.
        </p>
        <p>Beyond learning, I'm driven by the goal of starting a web and app development business
            that solves real-world problems—especially for underserved communities. One of my first
            projects is a halal travel guide targeting Muslims in America, offering verified halal
            options with a smooth and intuitive user experience.
        </p>
        <p>My ultimate vision is to achieve professional-level web development and software engineering
            skills within the next year, work remotely in tech, and use that freedom to support my
            family and live a life rooted in islam.
        </p>
